#Vertica
Installs [Vertica](http://www.vertica.com/) either standalone or part of a cluster.

Tested with Vertica 7.x

##Requirements
- vertica_ssh_key_location - location of where to create and place ssh keys for dbadmin
- vertica_dbadmin_password - password to be used for dbadmin on the database mon

##Optional parameters

- run_mode: One of Deploy, Stop, Install, Start or Logging. The default is Deploy which will do Install, Configure, then Enable. 'Start' and 'Logging' can only be run after the database is created via [Monasca-schema](https://github.com/hpcloud-mon/ansible-monasca-schema).
- vertica_database_name: Database name for the vertica database. Must be the same as in set in [Monasca-schema](https://github.com/hpcloud-mon/ansible-monasca-schema). Defaults to mon.
- vertica_license - Production license key to use when creating the database. By default the role will use the community license.
- vertica_use_apt: If True, vertica will be install from the apt repository. If False, it will be installed from the given local package. Default is False
- vertica_version: If set and vertica_use_apt is True, then the given version will be installed

If the variables `vertica_cluster` and `vertica_group` are both defined the nodes will be setup to be in a cluster.

vertica_cluster is a common separated list of the group of nodes that you want to be apart of your cluster and vertica_group
is set to that group from the ansible inventory file.

See the example playbook below.

## Other notes
Vertica recommends setting the kernel disk scheduling algorithm to deadline. This can be done by adding the kernel bootparam "elevator=deadline" then
restarting. This optimization is not done by the role.

This role does not create the database. That creation is in the role [Monasca-schema](https://github.com/hpcloud-mon/ansible-monasca-schema)

##Example Playbook

    hosts: vertica
    sudo: yes
    roles:
      - {role: vertica,
         vertica_group="{{groups['vertica']}}",
         vertica_cluster="10.10.10.1,10.10.10.2,10.10.10.3",
